# TEXT ENCRYPTION TOOL

üîπ **Text Cryptography is the process of converting between readable text, called plaintext , and an unreadable form, called ciphertext .**

üîπ **Encryption converts data into scrambled text. The unreadable text can only be decoded with a secret key. The secret key is a number that's: Created on your device and the device you message. It exists only on these two devices.**

üîπ **Encryption is used to protect data from being stolen, changed, or compromised and works by scrambling data into a secret code that can only be unlocked with a unique digital key.**

# Explanation:

**1. Encryption Options Menu:**

**‚Ä¢ User is prompted to choose
between encrypting a message or
exiting.**

**‚Ä¢ If option '1' is selected, the user is
asked to input the text and shift
amount for encryption.**

**‚Ä¢ If option '2' is selected, the program
exits.**

**2. Decryption Options Menu:**

**‚Ä¢ After encryption, the user is
prompted to choose between
decrypting a message or exiting.**

**‚Ä¢ If option '1' is selected, the user is
asked to input the text and shift amount for encryption.**

**‚Ä¢ If option '2' is selected, the program exits.**

**3. Error Handling:**

**‚Ä¢ If an invalid option is entered, an
error message is displayed and the
program exits.**


# HOW TO USE

```

```
git clone https://github.com/an0s-voldigoad/Text-Encryption.git
```

```
python text_encrypter.py
```

**IF ANY ISSUE OCCURED, USE PYTHON3**


*‚Ä¢ When Tool Opens, it will show you 3 options :*
**1. Encrypt (to encrypt texts)**
**2. Decrypt (to Decrypt texts)**
**3. Exit (to exit the program)**
